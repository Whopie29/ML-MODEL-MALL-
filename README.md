# Customer Segmentation Project

## Introduction
This project aims to perform customer segmentation using the KMeans clustering algorithm. The dataset contains information about customers including their age, gender, annual income, and spending score. The goal is to identify distinct groups of customers to help understand their behavior and preferences.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found [here](<add your dataset link>). Ensure you have saved the dataset at the location specified in the code.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run
1. Save the dataset at the specified location in the code.
2. Run the script to perform customer segmentation and visualize the results.

## Visualizations
The script generates several visualizations to help understand the data and the resulting clusters:
- Age distribution using a violin plot.
- Spending score and annual income distribution using box plots.
- Gender distribution using a bar plot.
- Age group distribution using a bar plot.
- Spending score distribution using a bar plot.
- Annual income distribution using a bar plot.
- Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- 3D scatter plot to visualize the customer segments.

## Clustering
The KMeans algorithm is used to segment the customers into different groups based on their age, annual income, and spending score. The script also includes a 3D visualization of the clusters.
